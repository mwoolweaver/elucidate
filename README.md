# Elucidate Elucubratus for Procursus

only `mobilesubstrate`, `cydia`, & their dependencies from [Elucubratus](https://apt.bingner.com)./

also hides `dummy packages` provided by [Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus/blob/master/build_tools/make_dummy.sh) .

## Issues

**will only work in `cydia` after installing the `Procursus` bootstrap via https://odysseyra1n.com/**
